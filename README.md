# üîé Recon Automation for Web Pentesting

This project is a **Python-based Reconnaissance and Automation Toolkit** designed to assist in **web pentesting, network scanning, and information gathering**.

It was developed and tested on **Kali Linux (running on VMware Workstation 16 Player)**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

### 1. **Network and Port Scanner**

* Built using **Python + Nmap library**.
* Detects if a host is alive.
* Performs TCP Port Scanning with service detection.
* Example usage:

  ```bash
  python3 NetworkAndPortScanner.py -o <HOST_IP> -p 22,80,443
  ```

### 2. **Recon Automation Tool**

A multi-functional script providing various pentesting utilities:

* **IP Scanner** ‚Äì Get local host and IP information.
* **Port Scanner** ‚Äì Multi-threaded port scanner with customizable modes.
* **Barcode Generator** ‚Äì Generate **EAN-13 barcodes** and save as PNG.
* **QR Code Generator** ‚Äì Generate QR codes from links.
* **Password Generator** ‚Äì Create random strong passwords.
* **Wordlist Generator** ‚Äì Generate custom password lists for brute-force attacks.
* **Phone Number Information Gathering** ‚Äì Get telecom provider and region details using `phonenumbers`.
* **Subdomain Checker** ‚Äì Discover subdomains using a built-in wordlist.
* **DDOS Attack Tool (Educational Purpose Only)** ‚Äì Simulates a Distributed Denial of Service attack. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Use responsibly in controlled environments only.**
